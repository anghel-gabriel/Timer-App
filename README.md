# TimerApp

⏳**In Search Of The Lost Time** - The app that wasn't written by Marcel Proust<br><br>

👋 This is one of my first apps written in pure JavaScript, created 🎯 thinking it will help me use the Pomodoro Technique (time management method). But I didn't want to limit it to that, so 💎 I set out to create a desktop application (it is not fully responsive at the moment) that would allow users adding multiple timers ⏰ that would play a sound 🔊 after the set time has expired.<br>

💻 To create this timer app I used: HTML, SCSS, JS, OOP, functional programming.
